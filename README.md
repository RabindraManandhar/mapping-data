**Goal**

In this project, the goal is to load a CSV file, extract specific information, transform the data into JSON and then save it to a new file.

For this project I have forked a Github repository "https://github.com/alfredodeza/mapping-data" which includes the CSV file to work with.

**Tasks**

1. Fork the above Github repository and use the exercise.ipynb Jupyter Notebook that has pre-loaded starting points. The Jupyter Notebook has already preloaded the CSV file with examples on how to use it with Pandas or a Dictionary with the csv modeul.

2. Use a distinct field to retrieve data, like:

* Type of wine (red or white)

* Highest rated wines (rating > 90.0)

* Region

3. Capture every row that matches above conditions, and after processing, save everything to a formatted new JSON file.
